# Nirbhaya---Women-Safety-App-Android
An Android application focused on women's safety with features like emergency contact, location tracking, and SOS alerts.
üí° Overview
The Women's Safety App is a comprehensive Android application designed to provide immediate assistance and a sense of security for women in potentially dangerous situations. The core mission of this project is to leverage mobile technology to empower users, giving them the tools to discreetly and rapidly alert their trusted contacts and emergency services when they feel unsafe. The app is built with a focus on ease of use, speed, and reliability.

‚ú® Detailed Features
SOS Alert System: This is the app's primary function, activated by a prominent, one-tap button on the main screen.

Automated Communication: Upon activation, the app automatically sends a pre-defined distress message via SMS to all designated emergency contacts.

Live Location Sharing: The message includes a link to the user's real-time location via GPS coordinates, allowing contacts to track their movements and pinpoint their exact location.

Silent Mode: The alert can be sent without any sound or notification, ensuring discreet use in sensitive situations.

Voice Activation: For situations where physical interaction with the phone is not possible, the app can be triggered by a specific voice command.

Customizable Phrase: The user can set their own unique wake phrase for a personal and secure experience.

Hands-Free Operation: This feature allows for a hands-free, rapid alert even if the phone is in a bag or pocket.

Shake-to-Alert: As an alternative to the tap and voice command, a vigorous shake of the phone will activate the SOS alert.

Discreet Activation: This provides a quick and discreet method of sending an alert without having to look at the phone screen.

Sensitivity Settings: Users can adjust the sensitivity of the shake gesture to prevent accidental alerts.

Fake Call: This feature provides a convenient way to exit uncomfortable or threatening social situations.

Scheduled Calls: Users can schedule a fake incoming call at a specific time.

Instant Activation: A single tap can also trigger the fake call immediately.

Custom Caller ID: The name and number of the "caller" can be customized to make the call more convincing.

Location Tracking: This functionality is integrated with the SOS alert system.

Real-time Updates: Emergency contacts receive a secure link that updates with the user's location in real time.

Enhanced Safety: This feature provides a continuous safety net, allowing contacts to monitor the user's progress to a safe location.

Emergency Contact Management: The app provides a dedicated section for users to manage their network of trusted contacts.

Add/Edit/Remove: Users can easily add, edit, and delete contacts from their list.

Contact Details: The app stores contact names and phone numbers securely.
